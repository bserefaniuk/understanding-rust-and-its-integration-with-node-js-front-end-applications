# Rust and Node.js Integration Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the integration of Rust with Node.js and front-end applications using WebAssembly (WASM). The examples include various methods to connect Rust with Node.js, such as using the Neon library, NAPI-RS, WebAssembly, and Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

## Examples

### 1. Neon Library
A simple example of creating a native Node.js module using the Neon library.

### 2. NAPI-RS
An example demonstrating how to use NAPI-RS for writing Node.js native addons in Rust.

### 3. WebAssembly & Node.js
An example of compiling Rust code to WebAssembly and using it in a Node.js application.

### 4. WebAssembly & Web
An example of compiling Rust code to WebAssembly and using it in a Web application.

### 5. Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
An example showing how to call Rust functions from Node.js using FFI.
